# SQL QUERIES
This repository contains a collection of various SQL query snippets that I have created for different projects. 
These snippets cover a wide range of topics and can be used as reference or inspiration for your own SQL projects.
The queries include examples of data manipulation, data aggregation, and data analysis, among other things. Whether 
you are a beginner or an experienced SQL developer, this repository is a great resource to have at your disposal. So
feel free to explore, learn, and use the snippets as you see fit.
